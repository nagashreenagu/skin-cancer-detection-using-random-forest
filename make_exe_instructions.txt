How to create a Windows EXE using PyInstaller (instructions included).

1. Install PyInstaller in your environment:
   pip install pyinstaller

2. From the project root, run:
   pyinstaller --onefile --add-data "templates;templates" --add-data "static;static" app.py

   On Linux/Mac use ':' as separator, on Windows use ';' as above.

3. After building, the executable will be in the 'dist' folder. Copy models.pkl and scaler.pkl into the same folder
   (or modify the code to load from an embedded resource).

Note: Building an EXE requires a Windows environment (or Wine) to build reliably for Windows. This repository includes
this instruction and a helper batch file 'build_exe_windows.bat' which you can run on Windows.
